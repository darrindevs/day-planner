1. The user see's today's date at the top of the planner
    > ⏰ use moments.js to dynamically updated the date  
2. The user should be able to enter items into a planner for today
    > Create a series of form inputs situated within a table
        > the table consists of 8 rows representing the hours of 9-5
        > the table has 3 columns: 
            1: the hour slot
            2: the text input
            3: a save button
3. Once a user inputs text into the form they can click the save button
    > the save button uses an event listener on the click to save the input to local storage
    > so that the input content is saved even after the page is refreshed
    > each input value is associated with a date so that it can be removed with it is no longer that date 
4. When the user views the planner they only see input options and saved content for TODAY 
    > views of the planner are dynamic based on the current time
    > ⏰ use moments.js to dyamically update views 
    > this includes the date at the top of the planner
    > this includes input content only for today
    > anything that was input and saved yesterday is no longer in view
    > all entries are for today and saved in local storage for view today
    > entries for yesterday are removed from local storage
    > upon load we will compare the current date to the saved date to deterimine whether or not to show the content
5. When the user views the planer each row is dynamically styled by color to represent the past (earlier today), present, or future (later today)
