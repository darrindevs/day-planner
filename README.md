## Deployed Application
[Code Quiz](https://darrindevs.github.io/day-planner/)

## Summary 
This fun little app is a calendar application that allows a user to save entries for each hour of the day. When the user clicks the save button their entries are saved to local storage. 

Times are updated using the Moment.js library. As the day progresses the hour blocks in the planner update their color dynamically. ✨ All magically powered by JavaScript. 

This app also makes use of third party APIs jQuery and Bootstrap.

## Code Snippet

// Moment.js gets current date and time 
var now = new Date().getHours();
console.log("now=" + now);

if (now > 9) {
$("#9").addClass("past");
} else if (now >= 9 && now < 10) {
$("#9").addClass("present");
} else if (now < 9) {
$("#9").addClass("future");
